"Your very first own library"

This is a project where it's supposed to write a library to be used in future 42 school c projects.

The idea is to mimic some existing functions and create some that can also be useful.

It contains:
  - Memory manipulation;
  - String (char *) manipulation;
  - Data type manipulation;
  - List manipulation;
